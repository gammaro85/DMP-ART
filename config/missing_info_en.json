  "GENERAL": [
    "The entire plan must be written in English. An English version is required.",
    "The plan must contain answers to all 6 questions with subsections (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.2). The auxiliary questions are only hints, they do not replace the main structure. Instead of answering \"What data... ? no\", write a full sentence: \"No existing datasets will be reused. All data will be newly collected.\""
  ],
  "1.1": [
    "Data description is too general. Specify type and approximate size: \"tabular data from surveys (CSV, approximately 50 MB), microscopic images (TIFF, approximately 2 GB), measurement results (TXT, approximately 5 GB)\" instead of \"research data\".",
    "Data collection methodology is missing. Add how the data will be created, with what tools, under what conditions, using what method."
  ],
  "1.2": [
    "File extensions are missing. Specify: \".csv, .jpg, .py, .txt\" instead of \"text files\". Formats can be divided into software-specific and commonly used.",
    "Indicate which formats are open and which are proprietary. If proprietary is necessary: consider exporting the final version to open formats or justify why conversion is not possible."
  ],
  "2.1": [
    "Description of folder structure and file naming is missing. Add at the beginning how data will be organized: that a folder structure will be created, and individual file names will be systematic and allow quick identification: \"Folder structure: /raw_data, /processed_data, /scripts, /results. File names: YYYY-MM-DD_experimentID_sampleID.csv\"",
    "Metadata description is incomplete. README should contain: description of research methodology, explanation of all variables with units and value ranges, data collection procedures, file and folder structure, software requirements, known limitations or quality issues, contact information."
  ],
  "2.2": [
    "Quality control is too general (\"high-quality data\"). Specify concrete procedures: \"Data entry double-checked by two independent researchers\", \"Equipment calibrated monthly according to manufacturer protocols\", \"Automated validation scripts for out-of-range values\", \"Laboratory notebooks meticulously kept in paper and digital versions\"."
  ],
  "3.1": [
    "Backup description is missing. Section 3.1 requires a description of storage during the project and backup strategy (media, frequency, location).",
    "Specifically list: laboratory disks (whose?), network servers (which?), cloud (which?), external disks (where stored?). Do not recommend DropBox (data may be deleted without notice, servers outside EU).",
    "How often will backups be created? Specify frequency for each medium (e.g. automatic daily to cloud, manual weekly to external disk)."
  ],
  "4.1": [
    "Research with humans: indicate the ethics committee approval status (approval number, date) or justify why the study does not require approval (in accordance with institutional regulations).",
    "If personal data is collected: add the legal basis (consent, contract, task carried out in the public interest), how participants are informed, data retention period, anonymization/pseudonymization procedure, data subject rights (access, rectification, deletion).",
    "Can everything be anonymized? Consider adding that anonymization will be applied where possible; if not possible, data will not be published or will be made available in a limited scope."
  ],
  "5.1": [
    "Embargo requires specific justification for why data cannot be shared immediately (analysis in progress, publication preparation, patent process, obligations to partners) and a specific embargo end date (\"31.12.2026\", not \"after project completion\").",
    "Partial access requires specifying: what will be publicly available, what will not and why, how the shared data allows verification of published results.",
    "CC0 may conflict with the Intellectual Property Regulations of the institution (rights to employee works belong to the institution). Check compliance with the regulations, consider CC BY as a safer alternative. In case of doubt: consult the university legal department.",
    "For data received from external companies: clarify whether it is a purchased service. If so, state this and emphasize that full rights to the data are held by the project."
  ],
  "5.2": [
    "It is worth adding information about the certificate: MOST Wiedzy Open Research Data Catalog (Bridge of Data) has the CoreTrustSeal certificate - the only certified research data repository in Poland, confirming compliance with international standards for trustworthy digital repositories.",
    "State in which repository the data will be stored. It does not have to be MOST Wiedzy - if there are other repositories better suited thematically, just ensure that data is shared in accordance with FAIR principles."
  ],
  "6.1": [
    "Specify data management costs. If repository deposit is free: state this clearly. The cost is primarily working time (estimate the number of working days for preparation, documentation, quality control)."
  ],
  "6.2": [
    "Identify who is responsible for data management (role, position, name). You may also mention the Open Science Competence Center as support for DMP verification and metadata for datasets in the repository."
